The BUSSIN’ app is a digital booking solution designed to eliminate the chaotic "agawan" (scramble) queuing system prevalent in Mindanao’s provincial bus terminals. Targeted at daily commuters, students, and inter-city travelers, the app allows users to reserve specific seats in advance rather than fighting for them on-site. I chose a bold Yellow and Black color scheme to mirror the industrial aesthetic of major bus lines and to ensure high visibility and urgency. The main challenge I faced was designing the Seat Selection interface to ensure it looked realistic and intuitive on a small screen without feeling cluttered. With more time, I would improve the prototype by adding a "Real-Time GPS" feature so passengers can track exactly where their arriving bus is located on a map.
