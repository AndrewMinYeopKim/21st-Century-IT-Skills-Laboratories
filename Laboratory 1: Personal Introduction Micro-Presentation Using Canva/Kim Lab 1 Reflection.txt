Andrew Min Yeop P. Kim - Reflection

Among the design principles in CRAP (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity), I found that proximity was most useful. There were multiple moments when I crowded my presentation which made the viewing experience stressful; this reminded me of the power of s p a c e. Speaking of stressful, the hardest part of Canva was the design brainstorming that I had to do which resulted in a lot of time investment into this supposedly simple activity. I realized how convenient Canva is, considering how my only difficulty was a skill issue. Throughout this activity, I learned about the incredible height of the skill ceiling of visual communication- and how much more I can improve.
